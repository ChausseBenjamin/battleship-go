# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## My Pledge

I do my best with the time I have.
Remember this is a side project which will always come 
after school, family, and work.

## My Standards

I am open to suggestions and do as I pledge

## My Responsibilities

I'm not your dad. Code of conducts ruin the free speach
policy open-source used to have. I won't tell you how to
behave and hope you were raised well. ;)
