Battleship-go (WIP)
---
A terminal based batlleship game written in go.

## About the project
I started this project to expand my knowledge of the go
programing language and have a little something to show
for it at the end. When this project will be done, you
should be able to play on a single computer a game of battleship
in a sexy terminal interface.

## Goals

- [  ] Know Go better
- [  ] Make a multiplayer game which can be played on a single computer
- [  ] Have a clean, simple, and easy to use interface

## Strech goals

- [  ] Allow the game to be played v.s. a computer algorithm
- [  ] Allow the game to be played on two different computers using SSH
